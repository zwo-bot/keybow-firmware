 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set

 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: Common files for SELinux policy management libraries
 This package provides the common files used by the shared libraries
 for SELinux policy management.
 .
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a
 number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to
 add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.

 for loading policy and for checking whether the file_contexts
 configuration is valid (load_policy and setfiles from
 policycoreutils) presently, although this may change at least for the
 bootstrapping case

 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.

Description: secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.
